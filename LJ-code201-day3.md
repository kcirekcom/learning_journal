# LJ Code 201 - Day 3

Today's lab was very frustrating with creating the loops and making sure they worked properly. It's crazy how the position of a single line can make or break your code. Once I finally got my code to work, it gave me a great chance for me to review it to understand it even better.

It was great when Sam walked us through the ACP cycle for Git on Tuesday. It helped a lot. When in doubt, type in 'git status' to see instructions for the next appropriate steps. I've become more familiar with the ACP cycle, so I don't have to use that command much, but it was a great reference for getting started.
